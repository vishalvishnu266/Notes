### Conclusion:

National interest remains a core concept in international relations. While the realist view treats it as power-centric and constant, modern developments—like climate change, technology, and global interdependence—require a broader, more flexible understanding. Its contested and dynamic nature reflects the evolving priorities of states in a complex global order.

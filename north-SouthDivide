### 1. Concept of North-South Divide  
- The North refers to developed, industrialised countries (Europe, USA, Japan).  
- The South refers to developing, poorer countries (Asia, Africa, Latin America).  
- The divide is economic, political, and institutional in nature.  
- Represents structural inequalities in global governance.

---

### 2. Historical Context  
- Emerged after World War II with decolonisation.  
- Institutionalised through NAM, G-77, and UNCTAD.  
- North pushed for liberalisation and environmental responsibility; South emphasised development, equity, and sovereignty.  
- **Rio Summit (1992)**: Climax of North-South conflict on environment; led to principle of *Common but Differentiated Responsibilities* (CBDR).

---

### 3. Causes of the Divide  
- Unequal global trade (terms of trade favour North).  
- Technological monopoly and digital divide.  
- Climate injustice (North contributed most historically).  
- Colonial legacy and debt burden.  
- Global institutions dominated by the North (e.g., IMF, WTO, UNSC).

---

### 4. Environmental Politics: North vs South  
- North: Advocates emission cuts and climate finance conditionalities.  
- South: Demands historical accountability, equity, and right to develop.  
- Example: India and China resisted binding cuts in Kyoto and Paris Agreements.  
- Conflicts in COP summits reflect unresolved historical responsibilities.

---

### 5. Structural Inequalities  
- North: High wages, capital-intensive economies.  
- South: Low wages, resource-based economies.  
- Proposed solutions:  
  - Fairer trade rules and reduced subsidies.  
  - Technology transfer and relaxed IPR.  
  - Democratisation of global institutions (e.g., IMF voting reform).  
  - Climate finance and aid (Green Climate Fund).

---

### 6. South-South Cooperation  
- Defined as collaboration among developing countries for mutual benefit.  
- Institutional Platforms: NAM, G-77, BRICS, IBSA, African Union, SAARC.  
- Focus areas: Trade, health, education, climate, technology sharing.  
- Prospects: Shared development goals, regional leadership by countries like India and Brazil.  
- Challenges: Diverse interests, limited funding, internal inequalities.

---

### 7. Critical Perspectives  

**Raul Prebisch**  
- Trade favours industrial core over raw-material-exporting periphery.  
- Proposed import-substitution and state-led development.

**Samir Amin**  
- Advocated "delinking" Southern economies from global capitalist system.  
- Highlighted exploitation through global division of labour.

**Johan Galtung**  
- Developed the idea of structural violence; global inequality as built-in oppression.

**Thomas Pogge**  
- Criticised global institutional order for perpetuating poverty and injustice.

**Vandana Shiva / Sunita Narain**  
- North has disproportionately consumed environmental resources.  
- Advocates for ecological justice and decentralised sustainable development.

**Amartya Sen**  
- Development should focus on capabilities, not just income.  
- Critiques one-size-fits-all neoliberal models.

---

### 8. Indian Perspective  
- **Indira Gandhi** (Stockholm, 1972): “Poverty is the worst polluter.”  
- **India's Role**: Champion of equity, CBDR, and South-South solidarity.  
- Involved in BRICS, International Solar Alliance, G-77 leadership.  
- **Manmohan Singh**: Advocated reformed global economic governance during G20 era.

---

### Conclusion  
North-South and South-South dimensions define the modern world order. While South-South cooperation offers a path for self-reliant growth, deep inequalities persist. A reformed, inclusive global order is essential to ensure justice, sustainability, and balance in international relations.

---------------------- ABBREVIATIONS USED ----------------------

1. IPR – Intellectual Property Rights  
   - Legal rights that give creators control over the use of their inventions, like green technologies.
   - Concern: Developing countries face high costs and access issues due to strict IPR protections.

2. CBDR – Common But Differentiated Responsibilities  
   - A principle from the 1992 Rio Earth Summit.
   - Recognizes that all countries are responsible for environmental protection but not equally—
     developed countries have a greater historical responsibility.

3. INDC – Intended Nationally Determined Contributions  
   - Voluntary national climate action plans submitted under the Paris Agreement.
   - They replaced legally binding emission targets with self-determined pledges.

4. COP – Conference of the Parties  
   - Annual climate conferences under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).
   - E.g., COP26 was held in Glasgow in 2021.

5. G77 – Group of 77  
   - A coalition of developing nations that promotes collective economic interests and enhances
     joint negotiating capacity at the UN.

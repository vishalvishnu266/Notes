Political party !=  Party system


ROLE OF POLITICAL PARTIES  
• Aggregate and articulate social interests into coherent policy platforms  
• Recruit, socialize, and train leaders for public office  
• Provide linkage between citizens and the state, 
• Enable peaceful alternation of power via regular elections  
• Institutionalize (embed into formal rules and procedures) predictable rules and routines  
• Manage inter-group conflict through coalition-building (forming alliances between parties or groups)  
• Promote social cohesion by forging cross-cutting alliances  

Examples / Illustrations  
• India: Congress, BJP mobilizing across caste and religious lines  

Challenges  
• Weak internal democracy → patronage (exchange of goods or favors for political support) and clientelism (exchange of goods or services for electoral support)  
• Personality / dynastic politics (leadership passed within families rather than by merit) → undermines institutional roots  
• Electoral volatility where parties lack societal roots  
• Military interventions in weak party systems  

Reforms & Way Forward  
• Mandate transparent, regular intra-party elections  
• Introduce public financing with strict audit and disclosure  
• Strengthen independence and capacity of electoral commissions (bodies that oversee free and fair elections)  
• Promote cross-cutting alliances to dilute zero-sum identity politics (mobilizing voters strictly along one identity axis)

INCLUSION OF UNDERPRIVILEGED GROUPS  
• Universal suffrage and affirmative action (policies that actively correct historical inequalities) expand inclusion  
• Identity-based parties channel marginalized voices  
• Enhanced representation builds legitimacy and grassroots leadership  

Examples / Illustrations  
• India’s BSP for Dalits, Mandal politics for OBCs  

Risks & Challenges  
• Vote-bank politics (targeting specific demographic groups with promises to secure votes) can deepen social divides  
• Fragmentation of party systems around narrow identities  

Reforms & Way Forward  
• Civic education to shift focus from patronage to issues  
• Transparent institutionalization of reserved seats and quotas  

---

VOTER TURNOUT DYNAMICS  
• Turnout = % of eligible voters casting ballots; 
indicator of democratic legitimacy  
• Influenced by political apathy (lack of interest), distrust, logistical barriers, and fatigue  

Examples / Illustrations  
• USA midterms often below 50% turnout  
• India’s urban apathy vs. rural mobilization  

Challenges  
• Complex registration procedures  
• Frequent elections leading to voter fatigue  

Reforms & Way Forward  
• Compulsory voting (e.g., Australia ~90% turnout)  
• Early, postal, and online voting; simplified registration  

---

IDENTITY AND POLITICAL PARTICIPATION  
• Identity markers: caste, ethnicity, religion, language, region, gender  
• Shapes voting behavior, party formation, and protest movements  

Examples / Illustrations  
• Caste voting in India; ethnic voting in Nigeria  
• Tribal land-rights protests in Latin America  

Risks & Challenges  
• Sectarianism and communal polarization  
• Undermines issue-based policy debate  

Reforms & Way Forward  
• Encourage cross-identity issue coalitions  
• Institutional checks on identity-based discrimination  

---

PARTY SYSTEM IN INDIA  
• Neither pure two-party nor purely multiparty; a hybrid model  
• National parties coexist with strong regional/caste-based parties  
• Federal dynamics drive regional mobilization  

Examples / Illustrations  
• National: BJP, Congress  
• Regional: DMK, TMC, SP  

Challenges  
• Coalition instability and policy gridlock  
• Personality-driven regional leadership  

Reforms & Way Forward  
• Electoral alliances built on programmatic coherence  
• Promote ideological platforms beyond identity cleavages  

---

STRUGGLE FOR REPRESENTATION IN INDUSTRIAL SOCIETIES  
• Expansion of suffrage (workers, women) in 19th–20th centuries  
• Rise of labor and socialist parties shifted policy toward welfare  

Examples / Illustrations  
• Chartist movement in Britain; women’s suffrage in early 1900s  

Challenges  
• Resistance from elites fearing loss of privilege  

Reforms & Way Forward  
• Cross-class alliances and social legislation addressing inequality  

---

IDEOLOGICAL & POLICY DIMENSIONS OF MODERN PARTIES  
• Ideology (liberalism, socialism, conservatism) offers clear voter choices  
• Policy research units and think-tanks professionalize party platforms  
• Adaptation to new media shapes message discipline and targeting  

Examples / Illustrations  
• European social-democratic welfare models  

Challenges  
• Clientelism (exchange of goods/services for votes) can overshadow ideological coherence  

Reforms & Way Forward  
• Strengthen party policy cells and stakeholder consultations  

---

POLITICAL MODERNIZATION IN INDIA  
• Linguistic reorganization of states accommodated identity claims  
• Panchayati Raj deepened grassroots democracy  
• Rise of media and civil society expanded the public sphere  

Examples / Illustrations  
• Green Revolution, mixed-economy policies  

Challenges  
• Persistent socio-economic inequalities constrain reach  

Reforms & Way Forward  
• Expand civic-tech platforms for participatory governance  

---

POLITICAL COMMUNICATION IN INDIA  
• Encompasses mass media, social media, and interpersonal networks  
• Agenda-setting (media highlighting certain issues) and framing shape electoral narratives  

Examples / Illustrations  
• TV debates, WhatsApp campaigns, street-corner meetings  

Challenges  
• Misinformation and echo chambers on social platforms  

Reforms & Way Forward  
• Media literacy programs and regulatory oversight of political ads

From s.gandhi

Burke :: Political Party
Set of people sharing common Ideology
coming together for promotion of National Interest


Sartori:: 
Party system is not based by noof parties
but by noof parties having systemic relevance
eg: till 1960 multiple party but one party dominant

Partha Chatterjee in an analysis of postcolonial  democracy in India, identifies the coexistence of two  kinds of societies - civil society (modernized like West)  and political society (run by survival needs).



Developing countries are prismatic (Fred  Riggs) where democracy has not been  instilled to the level of West. There is  coexistence of modernity and tradition  (Rudolphs) in India. Party system in India  is not western as rule of law is not  completely institutionalized as in the West.  Yet parties use Western vessel of elections  in democratic exercise, making them non  indigenous.

üìò THEORIES OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICS: SYSTEMS & FUNCTIONALIST APPROACHES

---

üîπ 1. SYSTEMS THEORY IN INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS

Definition:
A conceptual framework that views the international system as a set of interacting units (primarily states) operating under a pattern of inputs and outputs, influenced by structure and feedback.

Key Thinkers:

* David Easton (Political System as input-output mechanism)
* Morton Kaplan (Systemic models like balance-of-power, bipolar, universal, etc.)

David Easton‚Äôs Input-Output Model:

* Inputs: Demands and support from the environment.
* Conversion Process: Government processes inputs into decisions/policies.
* Outputs: Decisions/actions affecting the environment.
* Feedback Loop: Responses to outputs re-enter system as new inputs.
* Relevance: Applied in IR to understand policy formation in global context.

Kaplan‚Äôs Models of International System:

1. Balance of Power
2. Loose Bipolar
3. Tight Bipolar
4. Universal System (UN-like structures)
5. Hierarchy among Systems

Criticism:

* Too abstract, detached from realities of power and ideology.
* Ignores role of non-state actors and normative change.
* Limited predictive value in an anarchical system.

üîπ 2. FUNCTIONALIST APPROACH

Core Idea:
Promotes cooperation through integration of functions across states (economic, technical), gradually leading to political unity and peace.

Key Thinkers:

* David Mitrany ‚Äì ‚ÄúPeace by pieces‚Äù
* Ernst Haas ‚Äì Neo-functionalism, European integration

Central Tenets:

* Focuses on technical cooperation over political disputes.
* Believes in spill-over effect: integration in one area leads to others.
* Aims to build peace through non-political cooperation.

Relevance:

* Effective in European Union‚Äôs evolution.
* Encourages institution-building (e.g., WHO, WTO, UN agencies).

Criticism:

* Overlooks power and political motivations.
* Underestimates nationalism and state sovereignty.
* Not suitable for regions with low institutional trust.

üîπ 3. WORLD-SYSTEMS THEORY

Originator:

* Immanuel Wallerstein
* Developed in response to shortcomings in modernization theory and realism.

Key Concepts:

* World-Economy: Capitalist in nature, with division of labor.
* Three Zones:

  * Core: Industrialized, exploit periphery (e.g., US, Europe)
  * Semi-Periphery: Transitional economies (e.g., Brazil, India)
  * Periphery: Low-income, resource-supplying (e.g., Sub-Saharan Africa)

Relevance:

* Explains global inequality and dependency.
* Useful in analyzing neo-colonialism and economic imperialism.

Criticism:

* Economically reductionist.
* Understates role of domestic politics and agency.
* Doesn‚Äôt account for successful development of former peripheries (e.g., South Korea).

üîπ 5. CONTEMPORARY RELEVANCE

* Systems Theory: Still used in policy analysis and IR modeling but lacks tools to handle identity, values, and discourse.
* Functionalism: Relevant for explaining role of international organizations and transnational cooperation (e.g., health, climate).
* World-Systems: Growing importance amid global inequality, debates on neo-colonialism, and China's rise as new semi-core/core.

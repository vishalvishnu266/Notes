1. Definition & Distinction

- Interest Groups:  
  Organized groups seeking to influence policy without contesting elections.  
  Examples: Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), Bar Associations.

- Pressure Groups:  
  Subset of interest groups that exert pressure on decision-makers via lobbying, protests, media, etc.  
  All pressure groups are interest groups, but not all interest groups are pressure groups.

4. Types of Interest Groups (Gabriel Almond's Typology)

- Associational: Formal, specific aims (e.g., trade unions)  
- Non-associational: Based on ethnicity, religion, caste  
- Institutional: Part of government but act like interest groups (e.g., military, bureaucracy)

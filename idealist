IDEALIST APPROACH IN IR (NOTES)
===============================

1. CORE ASSUMPTIONS OF IDEALISM
--------------------------------
- Human nature is essentially good and rational.
- War is not inevitable; peace can be achieved through moral and legal norms.
- International relations should be based on justice, cooperation, and international law.
- International institutions (e.g., League of Nations, UN) are key to promoting peace.
- Emphasis on diplomacy, ethics, and democratic governance.

2. KEY THINKERS / SCHOLARS
----------------------------
- Woodrow Wilson:
  > Promoted 14 Points; seen as father of Idealism.
  > Believed in collective security and open diplomacy.

- Immanuel Kant:
  > Advocated "Perpetual Peace" through republicanism and federation of free states.

- Norman Angell:
  > Argued war is economically irrational in the modern world (The Great Illusion, 1910).

- Alfred Zimmern:
  > Early British idealist who stressed moral values and international cooperation.

3. HISTORICAL CONTEXT
----------------------
- Emerged after World War I as a response to the devastation of war.
- Influenced the creation of the League of Nations (1919).
- Declined after failure to prevent World War II; replaced by Realism in dominance.

4. CONTEMPORARY RELEVANCE
--------------------------
- Post-Cold War optimism revived elements of Idealism:
  > Growth of international law and institutions (e.g., WTO, ICC).
  > Emphasis on human rights, humanitarian intervention (e.g., R2P).
  > Peacebuilding efforts in post-conflict zones (e.g., UN in South Sudan, Kosovo).

- Useful in understanding:
  > Global governance
  > Soft power & diplomacy
  > Climate change cooperation

5. CRITICISMS
-------------
- Overemphasizes morality; ignores power politics.
- Underestimates anarchy and national interests in international system.
- Failed to predict/avoid World War II; seen as naïve by realists.

6. CONTRAST WITH REALISM

|---------------------|-----------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Human Nature        | Good, rational                    | Selfish, conflictual               |

CONTEMPORARY RELEVANCE OF IDEALISM
==============================

1. Revival Post-Cold War:
   - The end of bipolarity led to a resurgence of faith in international institutions and cooperative diplomacy.
   - Emphasis on global norms, multilateralism, and the spread of democracy reflects idealist thinking.

2. Role in Peacebuilding:
   - UN peacekeeping missions, nation-building in post-conflict societies (e.g., Liberia, Timor-Leste), and 
	reconciliation efforts are deeply inspired by idealist principles.
   - Idealism shapes the global peacebuilding architecture, focusing on justice, democracy, and institution-building.

3. Human Rights & R2P (Responsibility to Protect):
   - Growing international consensus on intervention in case of genocides or humanitarian crises (e.g., Syria, Libya 2011) shows moral responsibility over strict sovereignty—an idealist impulse.

4. Global Governance and Cooperation:
   - Climate change agreements (Paris Agreement), SDGs, WTO frameworks, and WHO coordination during COVID-19 highlight belief in collective solutions.
   - Idealist emphasis on law, norms, and institutions remains foundational to these efforts.

5. Criticism and Limits:
   - Realpolitik still dominates geopolitics (e.g., Ukraine war, US-China rivalry).
   - However, idealist tools like diplomacy, mediation, and global civil society remain active forces in shaping responses.

6. Indian Perspective:
   - India often promotes idealist values in forums like NAM, G-77, and UN, emphasizing peace, equity, and South-South cooperation.

-----------------------------
Conclusion:
While Idealism cannot fully explain conflict-driven geopolitics, it remains crucial in promoting peace, justice, and cooperative global order. In an interdependent world facing global challenges, idealism provides the moral and institutional foundation for long-term stability and cooperation.

==============================
CASE-BASED CONTEMPORARY RELEVANCE OF IDEALISM
==============================

1. PARIS CLIMATE AGREEMENT (2015)
----------------------------------
- Reflects idealist belief in international cooperation and collective responsibility.
- Countries voluntarily pledged Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) despite no binding enforcement.
- Emphasized equity, climate justice, and CBDR (Common But Differentiated Responsibilities), aligning with moral principles over pure national interest.

2. ICC (INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL COURT)
--------------------------------------
- Established to uphold global justice by prosecuting war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide.
- Embodies idealist commitment to international law and accountability.
- Despite criticisms (bias against Global South, lack of enforcement), it shows faith in a rule-based international order.

3. RESPONSIBILITY TO PROTECT (R2P)
-----------------------------------
- Developed post-Rwanda and Kosovo genocides to ensure humanitarian intervention in severe crises.
- Highlights idealist principle that sovereignty is not absolute when human rights are at stake.
- Applied in Libya (2011) and debated in Syria, though inconsistently.

4. UN PEACEKEEPING MISSIONS
----------------------------
- Idealism is central to peacekeeping in conflict zones (e.g., Democratic Republic of Congo, Mali).
- Aims at conflict resolution, state-building, and humanitarian relief through multilateral cooperation.

5. INDIA’S ROLE IN NAM & UN
----------------------------
- India continues to emphasize dialogue, peaceful coexistence, and South-South cooperation.
- Supports reformed multilateralism, climate equity, and development justice—reflecting Gandhian moral politics in foreign policy.

6. COVID-19 GLOBAL RESPONSE
----------------------------
- Initiatives like COVAX (vaccine sharing), WHO leadership, and calls for patent waivers (TRIPS) mirror idealist aspirations for global solidarity.
- Though uneven in implementation, they reflect the moral expectation that the world should act collectively in crises.

==============================
Conclusion:
Idealism may not dominate world affairs, but it shapes many global norms, treaties, and humanitarian actions. It remains essential in tackling shared challenges like climate change, pandemics, and global inequality where realism alone falls short.

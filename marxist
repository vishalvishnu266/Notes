MARXIST APPROACH TO INTERNATIONAL POLITICS
===============================

1. CORE PREMISES
----------------
- IR is shaped by the global capitalist system and class struggle.
- The state serves capitalist class interests rather than acting autonomously.
- Focus on imperialism, economic exploitation, and structural inequality.

2. KEY THINKERS (CLASSICAL & NEO-MARXIST)
------------------------------------------
- Karl Marx       – Class struggle drives history; capitalism breeds exploitation.
- V.I. Lenin      – Imperialism is capitalism’s highest stage, exporting capital to colonies.
- Immanuel Wallerstein – World-systems theory: core, semi-periphery, periphery hierarchy.
- Samir Amin      – “Delinking” South from global capitalism to pursue autonomous development.
- Robert W. Cox   – “Theory is always for someone”; global order reflects hegemonic interests.
- Stephen Gill    – Studies globalisation as “new constitutionalism” serving capital.
- David Harvey    – “Accumulation by dispossession” under neoliberalism.
- Mark Rupert     – Examines how culture and ideology serve capitalist relations.
- Benno Teschke   – Critiques state-centric IR; emphasizes historical specificity.
- Cynthia Enloe   – Explores gender and imperialism in global politics.

3. CONTEMPORARY SCHOLARS (GLOBAL POLITICAL ECONOMY)
----------------------------------------------------
- Saskia Sassen   – “Global city” concept; points to urban inequality under global capital.
- William Robinson – “Global capitalism and transnational class formation.”
- Ngaire Woods    – Analyses how institutions like IMF/WB perpetuate dependency.
- Giovanni Arrighi– Long twentieth century; cycles of capitalist accumulation.
- Kees van der Pijl– Transnational classes and the political economy of globalisation.

4. APPLICATION TO GLOBALISATION
-------------------------------
- Globalisation as intensified capitalist integration, deepening North-South divides.
- WTO, IMF, World Bank enforce neoliberal policies favouring transnational capital.
- Outsourcing, debt dependency, technology transfer regimes as forms of unequal exchange.
- Contemporary crises (2008 financial crash, COVID) reveal systemic instability inherent in capitalism.

5. DEBATE ON ECONOMIC REDUCTIONISM
----------------------------------
- Criticism: Reduces all IR phenomena to economic structures, downplays identity, culture.
- Response: Neo-Gramscian scholars (Cox, Gill) incorporate ideas, institutions, and power.
- Today’s Marxist IR combines economic analysis with attention to gender, environment, and race.

6. CONTEMPORARY RELEVANCE
-------------------------
- Explains systemic inequality, debt crises, and environmental degradation globally.
- Illuminates how MNCs and global value chains perpetuate labour exploitation.
- Provides critical lens on climate justice (historic responsibility of the North).
- Inspires anti-capitalist and decolonial movements across the Global South.

7. INDIAN PERSPECTIVE
---------------------
- Economists like Prabhat Patnaik and Utsa Patnaik apply Marxist critique to agrarian distress.
- Samir Amin’s ideas influenced India’s alternative development debates.
- NGOs and activists draw on Marxist analysis in campaigns against IMF-WB conditionalities.

8. KEY CONCEPTS & EXAMPLES
--------------------------
- Imperialism: Corporate land grabs in Africa; US military bases globally.
- Core-Periphery: High-tech exports from North; raw material exports from South.
- Accumulation by Dispossession: Privatization of public assets post-transition in Eastern Europe.
- Structural Violence: Debt bondage in developing countries; starvation under austerity.

===============================
Conclusion:
The Marxist approach—classical and neo-Marxist—remains vital for understanding exploitation, inequality, and power in contemporary international politics, especially under advanced globalisation.

REALIST APPROACH IN INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS

---

1. Core Assumptions of Realism

* Anarchy: The international system lacks a central authority, leading to a self-help environment.

* State-Centrism: States are the primary actors in international politics.

* Survival: The primary goal of each state is to ensure its own survival.

* Power Politics: States seek power to secure their interests and ensure survival.

* Rationality: States are rational actors, making decisions to maximize their interests.

---

2. Classical Realism vs. Neorealism (Structural Realism)

| Aspect                 | Classical Realism                               | Neorealism (Structural Realism)                  |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Key Proponent      | Hans J. Morgenthau                              | Kenneth Waltz                                    |
| Focus              | Human nature as the root of conflict            | Structure of the international system            |
| Cause of Conflict  | Innate human lust for power                     | Anarchical international structure               |
| Policy Implication | Prudence and moral considerations in statecraft | Emphasis on balance of power and systemic forces |
| View on Morality   | Morality plays a role in politics               | Morality is subordinate to systemic constraints  |

---

3. Offensive vs. Defensive Realism

| Aspect                  | Offensive Realism                          | Defensive Realism                                |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Key Proponent       | John Mearsheimer                           | Kenneth Waltz                                    |
| State Behavior      | States seek maximum power and hegemony     | States seek sufficient power for security        |
| View on Power       | Power accumulation is the path to security | Excessive power can provoke counterbalancing     |
| Conflict Likelihood | High, due to aggressive power pursuits     | Lower, as states are cautious to avoid overreach |

---

4. Realist Prescription for State Survival in Anarchy

* Self-Help: States must rely on their own capabilities for security.

* Power Maximization: Accumulating power deters potential threats.

* Balance of Power: Forming alliances to prevent any one state from becoming too powerful.

* Deterrence: Maintaining credible threats to discourage aggression.

---

5. Commonalities Between Realism and Marxism

* Materialist Focus: Both prioritize material factors—power in realism, economic structures in Marxism.

* Conflict-Centric: View international relations as a realm of conflict—power struggles in realism, class struggles in Marxism.

* Skepticism of Idealism: Both critique liberal and idealist notions of harmony and cooperation.

* State Behavior: States act in their own interests, influenced by power dynamics (realism) or capitalist imperatives (Marxism).

---

6. Postmodernist Critique of Realism

* Questioning Objectivity: Challenges the notion of objective truths in international relations.

* Deconstruction of Power: Analyzes how language and discourse shape power relations.

* Emphasis on Identity: Highlights the role of identity, culture, and norms, which realism often overlooks.

* Critique of State-Centrism: Argues that focusing solely on states ignores the influence of non-state actors and transnational forces.

---

7. Intellectual Precursors to Realism

* Thucydides: Emphasized power politics and the inevitability of conflict.

* Niccolò Machiavelli: Advocated for pragmatic and sometimes ruthless statecraft.

* Thomas Hobbes: Described the natural state as one of war, necessitating a strong authority.

* Carl von Clausewitz: Viewed war as a continuation of politics by other means.

---

8. Realism's Explanatory Power and Limitations

* Strengths:

  * Effectively explains power struggles, conflicts, and state behavior in an anarchic system.

  * Provides a clear framework for understanding international relations dynamics.

* Limitations:

  * Struggles to account for cooperation, international institutions, and non-state actors.

  * Often overlooks the impact of domestic politics, ideology, and economic interdependence.

---

9. Relevance of Realism in the Post-Cold War Era

* Continued Conflicts: Realism explains ongoing power rivalries and conflicts, such as those involving major powers.

* Rise of Multipolarity: The emergence of multiple power centers aligns with realist predictions about balance of power.

* Challenges: However, the increasing role of international institutions and norms presents challenges to realist explanations.

---

10. Conclusion

Realism remains a foundational theory in international relations, offering valuable insights into power dynamics and state behavior. While it has limitations, particularly in explaining cooperation and the role of non-state actors, its core principles continue to inform analyses of international politics.

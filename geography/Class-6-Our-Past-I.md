# Catal Huyuk 
A Neolitchic site
Find Turkey in your atlas. One of the most famous
Neolithic sites, Catal Huyuk, was found in Turkey.
Several things were brought from great distances
—flint from Syria, cowries from the Red Sea, shells
from the Mediterranean Sea — and used in the
settlement. Remember, there were no carts — most
things would have been carried on the backs of
pack animals such as cattle or by people.

1. Concept of Third World  
- Coined post-World War II to refer to newly independent countries of Asia, Africa, and Latin America.  
- Represented a political identity of the *non-aligned*, *postcolonial*, and *underdeveloped*.  

2. Political Characteristics of Third World States  
- State formation post-colonial rule, often weak institutions.  
- Mix of democratic aspirations and authoritarian practices.  
- Deep influence of Cold War politics, foreign aid, and intervention.  
- Rise of ethnic, regional, and tribal politics due to colonial boundaries.  

3. Economic Challenges  
- Structural dependency on Western economies.  
- Lack of capital, industrial base, and technological autonomy.  
- High levels of poverty, inequality, and resource exploitation.  

4. Theoretical Perspectives

a. Dependency Theory  
- Andre Gunder Frank, Samir Amin  
  - Underdevelopment is not a natural condition, but caused by capitalist exploitation.  
  - Peripheral economies are kept underdeveloped by core countries.  
  - *Delinking* from global capitalism is proposed as a solution.

b. World Systems Theory  
- Immanuel Wallerstein  
  - World is divided into core, semi-periphery, and periphery.  
  - Global capitalism ensures that periphery (Third World) remains dependent.

c. Postcolonial Perspective  
- Frantz Fanon, Kwame Nkrumah, Ashis Nandy, Arjun Appadurai  
  - Focus on cultural, psychological, and epistemic decolonisation.  
  - Challenges to Eurocentric modernity and imposed development models.  
  - Fanon advocated violent resistance to reclaim human dignity.

d. Political Development School (1960s-70s)  
- Lucian Pye, Ake Claude  
  - Emphasised need for political stability, legitimacy, and mass participation in new states.  
  - Criticised for being Western-centric and prescriptive.

e. Gandhian and Indigenous Views (Indian Perspective)  
- Rajni Kothari, Gandhi, Amartya Sen  
  - Development must be rooted in local democracy and decentralised governance.  
  - Global justice should focus on *capability*, not just GDP.  
  - Critique of top-down, elite-led development.

5. Goals of the Third World Movement for Global Justice  
- Establish equitable economic order (New International Economic Order – NIEO).  
- Right to self-determination and sovereignty.  
- Redistribution of global power (UN reforms, IMF/World Bank democratisation).  
- Cultural decolonisation and respect for indigenous development models.

---

6. Role of South-South Cooperation  
- Alternative to North-dominated institutions.  
- Shared challenges lead to collective bargaining (e.g., G-77, NAM, BRICS).  
- Regional cooperation (e.g., ASEAN, African Union, SAARC).  
- Technology sharing, trade agreements (like IBSA, India-Africa Forum Summit).

---

7. Criticisms and Challenges  
- Lack of unity among Third World states.  
- Internal governance failures and corruption.  
- Continued dependency on aid, loans, and technology from developed world.  
- Rise of new global divides (within South itself – e.g., India vs Sub-Saharan Africa).

Conclusion  
The Third World perspective highlights the limitations of the current global order and the need for more inclusive, just, and pluralistic international relations. While the movement has declined in intensity post-Cold War, the underlying demands remain highly relevant.
